<!-- Standard Epoch Report Formatting Macros -->
<!-- 
	"What's an epoch?"

	An epoch is an individual day, week, or month, etc., depending
	on the reporting frequency you have set in your configuration
	file. This macro file formats the report for a single epoch. 

	This macro file is also used for summary reports, and for
	reports generated from separate referrer log and user 
	agent log files. 
-->

<!-- Include the prologue first to get
	standard macros like date-format. -->

<!-- Standard macros used by many reporting macro sets -->




<!--	Here we write a fairly ordinary-looking HTML page,
	inserting the macros for the components of the
	epoch report where we want to see them. 
	We also define important formatting macros
	before we use them, or use other macros that
	rely on them. -->

<!-- epoch-range is used as the title and header. Only one of
	these variations will be used. -->

The report macro set currently in use requires frames.
If you prefer a browser that does not support frames,
you may wish to modify the Wusage reporting macros.
