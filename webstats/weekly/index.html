<!-- This history "report" is typically empty, because each
	graph gets its own page, and the individual epoch reports
	provide buttons to jump to the graph pages. However, we chose
	to accomplish this through macros in order to give you the
	option of changing the behavior. -->

<!-- Include the prologue first to get
	standard macros like date-format. -->

<!-- Standard macros used by many reporting macro sets -->




<!-- 1. Formatting Macros -->

<!-- The history report can consist of several table/chart pairs
	for separate totalsgroups. -->
	
<!-- history-table-format wraps around the history chart, creating a
	web page with the chart, the chart labels, and the rows of actual data
	at appropriate points. Note the use of openfile to put
	each graph in a separate file. -->


<!-- Labels a single item in a history chart. -->


<!-- Formats a single row of the history table. -->


<!-- This macro describes a range of dates. -->


<!-- 2. Page Layout

	Here we write a fairly ordinary-looking HTML page,
	inserting the macros for the components of the
	history report where we want to see them. -->

<!-- Insert the history tables. This built-in macro calls
	history-table-format as many times as necessary
	for distinct totalsgroups. -->

This particular macro set does not create a separate index for
each frequency setting. Navigation is accomplished through
the <a href="../index.html">calendar of reports</a>. This page exists
as a placeholder for users who wish to design their report
macros differently.
